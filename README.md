## How It Works

1. **Content Extraction:** Using a document reader, texts are extracted from a uploaded pdf / word file.
2. **Quiz Generation:** The extracted captions are then fed into OpenAI's LLM using [`LangChain Python`](https://python.langchain.com/) with a predefined prompt template. The model generates questions based on the content, turning the video's key points into an interactive quiz.
3. **Streamlit Integration:** The quizzes are seamlessly integrated and displayed in a Streamlit app, providing users with a unique and interactive experience.
